                <p>While pursuing my Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering at Arizona State University (ASU), I’ve gained valuable insights that have enhanced my technical and professional skills:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Problem-Solving Through Engineering Principles:</strong> Courses in mechanics and thermodynamics taught me how to break down complex problems into manageable parts, a skill I now apply to both academic and real-world challenges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Management and Discipline:</strong> Balancing coursework with my professional responsibilities has honed my ability to prioritize tasks and meet deadlines, a critical skill in high-pressure environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration and Teamwork:</strong> Group projects at ASU emphasized the importance of effective communication and collaboration, preparing me to work efficiently with diverse teams in my career.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Lessons from Previous Jobs</h2>
                <p>My 20+ years of experience in construction, logistics, and operations management have provided me with practical lessons that continue to guide my professional journey:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Leadership Under Pressure (CB Construction):</strong> As the owner of CB Construction, I managed large-scale projects and teams of up to 30 employees. Leading disaster recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina taught me how to remain calm and make strategic decisions in high-stress situations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety as a Priority (Green Metals Inc.):</strong> Serving as Safety Committee President for two years reinforced the importance of proactive safety measures. I learned how to implement and enforce safety protocols, reducing risks and fostering a culture of accountability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency Through Process Improvement (Futaba):</strong> Working as a Stamping Operator at Futaba, I applied Toyota’s Kaizen and 5S methodologies to streamline operations, a practice I now use to optimize workflows in any role.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adaptability and Resilience (ISA):</strong> Operating heavy machinery and managing scrap yard logistics at ISA taught me how to adapt to changing conditions and maintain efficiency, even in challenging environments.</li>
                </ul>
